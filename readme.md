# Wierd Language
Welcome to Ianyourgod's wierd language!
This is a compiled language, which can then be run on the custom emulator built in with the language.
## Computer part
Built in computer B)
### The Emulator
This is a simple emulator. It is not necessarily copying anything, more just an adaption of what I believe the computer I would build would be like.
### The Assembly
As stated above, this is a custom emulator. This means I will also have a custom assembly language. This assembly language is a bit higher level than the byte code, but still pretty low level.
### The Bytecode
This will probably not be explained well, as I will not be writing docs for it and if I do they wil be pretty simple. This is because who tf is going to be directly writing the bytecode.
## The Actual Language
